[HRV]
Heart rate variability increases during relaxing and recovering activities and decreases during stress. 
Accordingly, HRV is typically higher when the heart is beating slowly and decreases as the heart beats more quickly. 
In other words, heart rate and HRV have a generally inverse relationship.

There is also a significant number of “average” health seekers and a number of people rehabilitating from serious injuries, illnesses, or diseases. 
The average HRV score for Elite HRV users is 59.3 (on a 1-100 scale) with 75% of users' HRV scores falling between 46.3 and 72.0.

Over the past few decades, research has shown a relationship between low HRV and worsening depression or anxiety. 
A low HRV is even associated with an increased risk of death and cardiovascular disease.
People who have a high HRV may have greater cardiovascular fitness and be more resilient to stress.


[CARDIAC DISEASE RISK]
f your risk score was calculated to be more than 15%, you are thought to be at high risk of getting heart, stroke or blood vessel disease 
(cardiovascular disease) in the next five years. That means if everyone with a risk score of more than 15% was grouped together, about 1 in 7 
would get cardiovascular disease within the next 5 years.

If your risk score is between 10—15%, you are thought to be at moderate risk of getting cardiovascular disease in the next five years.

If your risk score is less than 10%, you are thought to be at low risk of getting cardiovascular disease in the next five years.


[BLOOD PRESSURE] + BMI > 25
According to the most recent guidelines for the management of hypertension, BP is classified as:
normal for systolic BP (SBP) <120 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) <80 mmHg); 
pre-hypertension for SBP between 129 and 139 mmHg and/or DBP between 80 and 89 mmHg; 
stage 1 hypertension for SBP between 140 and 159 mmHg and/or DBP between 90 and 99 mmHg and; 
stage 2 hypertension for SBP values ≥160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥100 mmHg9.

The top number (systolic) minus the bottom number (diastolic) gives you your pulse pressure. 
For example, if your resting blood pressure is 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), your pulse pressure is 40 — which is considered a normal 
and healthy pulse pressure. Generally, a pulse pressure greater than 40 mm Hg is abnormal.

Measuring your pulse pressure may help your doctor predict if you're at risk for a heart event, including a heart attack or stroke. 
If your pulse pressure is greater than 60 it's considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, especially for older adults.
